      <h2>Shooting: Proper Shooting Technique</h2>
      <p><strong>Focus On These Areas:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stance and Balance:</strong> Feet should be shoulder-width apart, slightly staggered, and facing the basket (or slightly angled for an open stance).</li>
        <li><strong>Shot Pocket:</strong> Position the ball at waist height, in line with your shooting eye and the basket.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow Through:</strong> Extend your shooting arm fully, with your elbow over your head and your wrist bent, holding the finish until the ball hits the net.</li>
        <li><strong>Elbow Under the Ball:</strong> Ensure your elbow is aligned directly under the ball, not out to the side.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent Release:</strong> Aim for a smooth, fluid motion, releasing the ball before you reach the top of your jump.</li>
        <li><strong>Eyes on Target:</strong> Keep your eyes focused on the rim throughout the shot.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dribbling: Ball Handling Development</h2>
      <p><strong>Areas To Focus On:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finger Control:</strong> Use your fingertips to control the ball, not your palm. This gives you more precision and power.</li>
        <li><strong>Eyes Up:</strong> Practice dribbling without looking at the ball. This improves your court awareness and allows you to see passes and plays.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Low:</strong> Bend your knees and keep your center of gravity low. This provides better balance and control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Additional Tips:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start slowly:</strong> Focus on technique before increasing speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice regularly:</strong> Dedicate time to dribbling drills, including stationary work and moving with the ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Improving your dribbling takes time and consistent effort.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Defence: How to defend against different types of players</h2>
      <p><strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Put the defender off balance:</strong> Fake like you're going one way and go the other, and once the defender's body has shifted to try to catch up to you, that's when you go back the other direction. Cut the ball past the standing foot of the defender. If you want to get to the outside, touch the ball towards the inside then touch the ball back down the line.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the ball close to you so you can cut in either direction:</strong> Dribble the ball with each step you take. This brings the defender close to you and allows you to quickly move the ball where you want.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempt the defender to try to win the ball and then accelerate into space:</strong> The key is to go directly at the defender and increase your speed once you've thrown them off balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Know when it is the right time to dribble:</strong> The best dribblers know when it's not on; they start over and wait for another chance to beat the defender. Look for the times when you’re one-on-one and there is open space behind your defender.</li>
      </ul>
